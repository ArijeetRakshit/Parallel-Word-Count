I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Animated by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. I try to suppress them, but they hurry me onward to those lofty regions where the sun is forever visible, its beams playing upon the unchangeable ice. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true, but what good is served by this? Only to display my own enthusiasm, which, however, can be of but little benefit to my readers.

I have already described to you, dear Margaret, the progress of the expedition. I am here by choice, not by compulsion. I have no friends here, no family, and no one to share my triumphs or console me in my failures. But I do not complain. I am engaged in an arduous but delightful enterprise, and if I succeed, I shall become a public benefactor. And if I fail, I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that I did my best.

I am about to undertake a most perilous journey, one that will carry me to the unexplorable regions of the North. I shall brave the most frightful storms, encounter the most savage beasts, and endure the most agonizing cold. But I shall not shrink from my purpose. I am determined to penetrate the secrets of the universe, to discover the source of life, and to create a new race of beings.

I have prepared myself for this journey in every possible way. I have studied all the relevant scientific treatises, consulted with the most eminent philosophers, and even conversed with the most experienced mariners. I have also assembled a team of courageous and devoted men, who are willing to follow me wherever I may lead.

I have no doubt that I shall succeed. My spirit is as ardent as ever, and my body is as strong. I have the support of my crew, and the blessing of God. I shall return to England a hero, or I shall perish in the attempt. But I shall never abandon my quest.
